This repository is the starting point for the SAP Community Code Challenge for Cloud Native (see [SAP Community Coffee Corner thread]() and [corresponding blog post]()). The repository contains a basic Hello-World type [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) project which has a everything included which you need to deploy that service to a Kubernetes based runtime. That means you get the Node.js related files of the service, a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) and a [Deployment.yaml](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) file. If you're like "Oh Gosh, what is he talking about?" - No worries we will get to what all of that means. The goal for this months Coding Challenge is to bring the world of [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io), Containerization and the [SAP BTP, Kyma runtime](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/kyma-runtime) closer to you so you have an easier start with the world of Cloud Native development.

## Participation
Complete the following steps to take part in the challenge:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone the forked repository into your development environment.
3. Execute `npm install` to install the project's dependencies.
4. Open a pull request to the base repository.
5. Copy the URL of your pull request and paste it into the [SAP Community Coffee Corner thread](https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/coffee-corner/sap-community-code-challenge-testing-ui5-apps-with-wdi5/td-p/5229).

As this challenge is there to give you an easier start with Cloud Native technologies like Kubernetes, Containers and the SAP BTP, Kyma runtime the service being provided is really basic. You should focus more on understanding all the basics of this fairly complex topic. No worries there is more then enough content ready for you to feel like a Kubernetes pro after these 4 weeks! üßë‚Äçüíª üòâ

You can find the challenges for each week in the [Challenges](Challenges.md) file.
